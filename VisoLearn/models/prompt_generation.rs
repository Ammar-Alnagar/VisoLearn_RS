PARAMETERS:
- Difficulty: {}
- Person's Age: {}
- Autism Level: {}
- Topic Focus: {}
- Treatment Plan: {}
- Image Style: {}
CRITICAL PROMPT REQUIREMENTS:
1. START WITH A CLEAR CONCEPT: Begin with "A {} [scene description]" or "An {} of [scene description]"
2. ULTRA-SPECIFIC VISUAL DETAILS: Include at least 8-10 specific visual elements with clear positions and relationships
3. EXACT COLOR SPECIFICATION: Use precise color terminology (e.g., "pastel mint green" not just "green")
4. LIGHTING DIRECTIVES: Specify lighting quality (e.g., "soft diffused morning light", "dramatic side lighting")
5. CAMERA ANGLE & PERSPECTIVE: Include exact viewing angle (e.g., "eye-level close-up", "overhead view")
6. ARTISTIC STYLE: Reference specific art styles appropriate for autism education reflecting the selected style: {}
7. EMOTIONAL TONE: Explicitly state the emotional quality (e.g., "calm", "joyful", "serene atmosphere")
8. TEXTURE SPECIFICS: Detail textures visible in the image (e.g., "soft plush texture", "smooth polished surface")
9. Realism: Incorporate elements, textures, and lighting to enhance the image's depth according to the {} style.
TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Your prompt MUST be at least 150 words long
- Include the exact phrase "high detail, high quality , 4k" in your prompt
- End with a technical directive: "8k resolution, professional {}, masterful composition"
- Add style-appropriate elements for {} imagery
- Ensure the Image follows the {} style guidelines
- Ensure the Image is not blurry or pixelated.
- Ensure the Image is not overly saturated or desaturated.
- Ensure the Image is not overly bright or dark.
- Ensure the Image is not overly contrasty or flat.
- Ensure the Image is not overly abstract or overly detailed for the selected style.
- Ensure there are no deformations or distortions.
- Ensure the image is not blurry
-Ensure maximum detail and  quality.

TOPIC INTEGRATION:
The image MUST focus primarily on "{}" while incorporating elements from the treatment plan: "{}".
EXAMPLE FORMAT:
"A {} scene of [main subject] with [specific details]. The [subject] is positioned [exact location] with [specific posture/action]. The lighting is [specific lighting description] creating [specific effect]. The background features [specific background elements] in [specific colors]. The foreground includes [specific foreground elements]. The scene conveys a feeling of [emotional quality]. In the style of [specific artistic reference]. High detail, sharp focus, 8k resolution, professional {}, masterful composition."
